SECTION-4

 Google compute engine cost optimization.
 
 sustained use discounts 
 --> Automtic discoounts for running vm instances for significant portion of the billing month.
 Applicable for instances created by google kubernetes engine and compute engine.
 restriction--> does not apply to certain machine (E2 and A2).
 restriction --> does not apply to app engine flexible and dataflow.
 
 Commited used discount 
 
 used for workload with predictable resource need.
 commited for 1 to 3 yrs.
 can get discount upto 70%  and this discount is greater than sustained used discount.
 can be applicable for google  kubernetes engine and vm compute engine.
 not applicable for app created by engine flexible and dataflow.
 
 
 preemitable discounts 
 - short lived cheaper vm instances
 - had to stop within 24 hrs only.
 - used when workload is not immediate.
 - not always available, no sla and cannot be migrated to regular vm.
 
 spot vm 
 - It is latest version of preemitable vms.
 - no maximum runtime unlike preemitable vms.
 
 google compute engine billing
 - you are billed every second. after 1 minute of usage.
 - you r not billled when vm instance is stopped.
 - but charged for storage attached with it.
 -recomendation- create budget alert in billing section.
 
 save money -  choose the right machine type and image type.
 be aware of discounts available 
 sustainable discounts
 commited used discounts
 preemitable discounts.
 spot vm discounts.
 
 
 
 live migration and availability policy
 
 how do you keep vm instance running when a host system needs to be updated( a software or a hardware update needs to be performed)
 -Live migration  
   - your running vm instance is migrated to another host in the same zone.
   - does not change any attributes or properties of vm .
   - supported for instance with local ssds.
   - not supported for gpus and preemitable instance 
   
   important configuration - Availability policy
   on host maintenance -what should happen during periodic infrastructure maintaeneave 
   
   automatic restart.
 
 
 Compute engine features: custom machine types
 
 when predefined vm option  is not enough appropriate for your workloads we use custom machine. we crate custom machine type customized 
 for your need.
 
 custom machine type : adjust vcpus, memory and gpus
 choose between E2,N2,N1 machine types. support variety of operating systems - ubuntu, centos, debian redhat,windows,coreos.
 
 billed per cpus , memory provisioned to each instsnce  
 
 
 GPUs -
 GPUs are very important in math intensive worloads and graphic intensive workloads for AI/ML
 add gpu to virtual machine - 
 it has higher cost, 
 use images with gpu libraries installed , otherwise gpu will not work.
 not supported  on all mahine types.
 on host maintenance can only have terminate vm instance 
 recommended availability ploicy for gpu 
 automatic restart on
 
 
 - machine availability can vary from region to region.
 - you can change the machine type of a stopped instance only.
 -vm's can be filtered by various properties.
 - instance are zonal(run in specific zone)'
 - images are global
 - instance templete are global.
 -automatic monitoring is enabled.
 -for memory utilization and disk space utilization - cloud monitoring agent is needed.
 
 choose zone and region based on - cost , regulation, availability needs, latency and specific hardware needs.
 
 
 scenario and solutions
 1. what are the pre-requisites to be able to create a vm instance?
 solution - 1. project
                 2. billing account
				 3. compute engine APIs should be enabled.

2. you want dedicated hardware for your compliancee, licensing and management  needs.
solution -  use solo tenant nodes

3. i have 1000s of vm and i want to automate os patch management os inventory management and os configuration management( manage 
software installed) 
solution - use vm manager 

4. you want to login to vm instance to install software
solution - you can use ssh into it.
