google compute engine .

external ip -  these are internet addressable .
internal ip - these are ip which connected in corporate network.

we cannot have 2 different external ip for same resources.
we can have same internal ip for 2 different corporate network.

once we stop vm instances external ip changes. to solve this problem we use static ip.
step to attach static ip to vm instances.

go to search --> type external ip --> click on reserve static ip --> give name to static ip and then fill other options  then press ok-->
change option will appear on right of static ip created --> click on change option --> attach the static ip created to vm instance you want.

there is charge of static ip created . 
static ip remain appear if you stop the vm instance. 
you will be charge from static ip even if you stop tdelete vm instance. we have to release static ip from this option ( option will appear from where we have created the one.)

ec2- instance type -2 (  late number 2 represent the no of cpus.)

to decrease the steps involved in launch of instance. we use the following steps 

 1. startup script
 2. instance templete
 3. custom images.
 
 bootstrap- install os patches or software during launch of vm instance.
 
 1. startup script --  write the script for installing software( like apache) in meta section during launch of vm instance.
                           this process is time consuming because time will be needed to install software during lauch of vm instance.
						   

2. instance templete- - instance templete is created to decrease the lauch time of vm instance .
                                      we will create instance templete in which we define the machine type, startup script , storage, image, other properties.

3. custom images. -- this reduces further time to lauch of instance . we use hardened copy of image.
