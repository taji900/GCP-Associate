SECTION -2 

region and zone --> if we have application deployed in data center in london. it will have 2 problem
 1. high latency - if we have accesing application from mumbai then we have high latency.
 2. low availability - if data center crashes, then we our application suffers. 
 
 to solve both problem we will increase data center that solves low availability issue. if we access application from nearest data center then we will achieve low latency.
 
 Region -->  these are nothing but geographical location to host your resources. 
 adavantages-- high availability, low latency, adherence to gov clearence.
 
 zones--> it increase availabilty within region . each region has 3 or more zones .
                zones are cluster of data center interconnected with each other. with low latency.
				
				data centers have high connectivity.
